  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The blueberries in these whole wheat pancakes are so sweet and moist that they don't even need butter when eaten while hot! </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1¼ cups whole wheat flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 cup milk, plus more if necessary</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon artificial sweetener</li>
    <li>½ cup blueberries</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Sift together flour and baking powder, set aside. Beat together the egg, milk, salt and artificial sweetener in a bowl. Stir in flour until just moistened, add blueberries, and stir to incorporate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, and spray with cooking spray. Pour approximately 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan for each pancake. Cook until bubbly, about 1 1/2 minutes. Turn, and continue cooking until golden brown.
